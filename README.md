# SoC-based-on-PZEM-17-for-HA
Is a set of sensors and automations for HA to have software calculated state of charge in kW/h and percentage


How to connect PZEM-17 to HA you may find here:

So, if you wish to have an accurate SoC, especially, having a few batteries, so a shunt is needed.

A shunt may cound the resulting enegry and estimate how much energy is left in your batteries.
